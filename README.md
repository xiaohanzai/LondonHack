# Mad Moles
## -- learn about 3D vectors in mixed reality

This project is created during XR hack 2024 in London.
We created a mixed reality game that teaches teenage kids about 3D vectors by letting them shoot moles in their own environment.
Player needs to choose the correct vector direction to shoot the moles from a palm menu on their left hand.
The game progresses by teaching about 2D vectors on the floor first, and then moving to 3D vectors using the whole space.
